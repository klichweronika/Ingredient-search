# Ingredient-search

This app is written in Next.js. The main page presents a form with a field with searched ingredients. The UI is built with Chakra UI library. For getting ingredients I used spoonacular API.

## Build and run the project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to the page and create an account: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard.
3. When you successfully create an account, copy API KEY from API Console.
4. Create .env file in the main folder and paste:
   > - API_USER_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
5. Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your real key.
6. Run in console:
   > - yarn install
   > - yarn dev

### Scope

- didn't have enough time to write tests. This is something that needs to be complete, because I think writting tests is one of the fundamentals of succesfull project.
